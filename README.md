# Advanced-Database-Management
This concept map is to summarize what I've learned from the course DTSA 5735(Advanced Topics and Future Trends in Database Technologies) for Data Scientists Master program in the University of Colorado Boulder. The instructors are  Di Wu and Alan Paradise. 

Basically, I started with week 1 and summarized the concepts one by one for the entire course. The whole course revolves around advanced database management. The course begins with DBMS management with structured data. Here, three main topics are discussed: Transaction Logs, Database Backup & Recovery, and Database Concurrency. The focus is on finding solutions for managing large structured databases, ensuring their consistency, maintaining and updating them, and handling scenarios like network failures. Trade-offs such as consistency vs. speed are also examined. Among the key concepts discussed are backup and replication, transaction control, backup types, ACID, and concurrency control.

Continuing with structured data, we delve deeper into database design based on specific purposes: Operational DBMS (OLTP) and Data Warehouses (OLAP). Here, the properties and pros and cons of each are discussed. For OLAP, because it is based on a multi-dimensional data model that relies on data cubes, concepts of data cubes are explored. Within data cubes, topics such as OLAP operations, lattice of cuboids, schemas, and aggregation methods are discussed. Additionally, some database job roles are introduced at this stage.

After completing the discussion on database management with structured/relational data, we move on to Big Data. We cover big data characteristics (the V's), its architectures (various layers), and the associated challenges.

With the introduction of big data, we address the limitations of relational databases and introduce two main solutions: enhancing traditional relational databases or switching to NoSQL. The pros and cons of each solution are discussed. Starting with the first solution (keep relational database), we introduce two sub-solutions: scaling out and scaling up. For each sub-solution, we discuss their properties, advantages, and disadvantages, as well as related topics such as vertical/horizontal scaling, clustering, and techniques for addressing relational problems like replication, parallelization, and sharding. The properties of these techniques and important concepts, such as the role of the ‘watcher’ and the two modes of replication (primary to secondary and peer-to-peer), are explored.

For the NoSQL solution, we discuss its properties, pros and cons, as well as the concepts of aggregations and the four basic NoSQL database models: document store, graph, key-value pairs, and column family. Each model is discussed in detail.
